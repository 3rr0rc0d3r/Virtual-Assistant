NOTE: This is not the fully-working software. It just contains the GUI Java Swing app code and the __main.py__ file from
SpeechRecognition library. If you need the fully-working project, mail me at devangverma@hotmail.com

# Virtual-Assistant
Python's SpeechRecognition API connected with Front-end GUI written in Java. 
The original API receives voice as input and displays it on the screen. 
I've modified the API's code to also do tasks on the system by running system commands. 
A machine running Linux is required.

PREREQUISITES:

1. Python 2.7

2. SpeechRecognition Library
   For details and installation, visit : https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/
   Run ':~$ pip show SpeechRecognition' to see if it has installed correctly.
   
3. Any GNU/Linux based machine to run the software.

4. A microphone (in-built or external; a normal headset's microphone would also work if detected proeprly).

If you're unable to run or configure the code, mail me at devangverma@hotmail.com
